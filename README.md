# **AI-Powered Real Estate Recommendation System â€“ Gurugram**

### **Project Overview**
This project uses prompting techniques and multi-model evaluation (ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Perplexity) to build a real estate recommendation system for home buyers in Gurugram. It acts as a personalized decision support assistant that helps users navigate affordability, rent vs. buy trade-offs, and investment choices, based on their financial profile and preferences.

### **Objectives**
- Design a reusable, prompt-based framework for home-buying decision support using generative AI.  
- Generate location-specific real estate insights according to a userâ€™s income, preferences, and priorities.  
- Compare outputs from leading LLMs to identify the most insightful and reliable model.

### **Key Technical Achievements**
- Designed a chained prompting system to guide LLMs through research, personalization, and recommendation steps.  
- Tested and benchmarked multiple LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT-4, Perplexity) for clarity, depth, and alignment with real-world user needs.  
- Developed a custom EMI and rent-vs-buy assessment flow, integrating net income growth and user-defined emotional trade-offs.  
- Built a prompt-powered knowledge base using a structured real estate playbook and personalized questionnaire.

### **Key Insights**
- Prompt quality and chaining heavily influence the depth and usability of LLM responses.  
- Gemini and ChatGPT-4 provided more analytical and cost-aligned recommendations, while Perplexity was better for initial domain research.

### **My Key Learnings**
- Designing effective, structured prompts is critical for extracting personalized outputs from LLMs.  
- Different LLMs have strengths depending on the task (e.g., research vs. personalization vs. reasoning).  
- AI tools can be used as effective assistants in domains like real estate and financial planning.
